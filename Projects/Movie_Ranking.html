<h1>THE BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO THEOPHILUS</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-times</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Halo</h3>
<p>
  This is actually a sci-fi movie which captures the exhibition and the use of
  modern technologies especially in the area of military might.<br />I really
  love and enjoy the story line from start to finish.
</p>
<h3>Den Of Thieves</h3>
<p>
  This is a classic movie show casing master thinking and technology in the
  space of crime.
</p>
<h3>Iwoji</h3>
<p>
  This is an anime movie with its background from Nigeria with a blend of
  artificial intelligence in robot creation and use.<br />It is really a banga
  and best movie to choose for a movie night
